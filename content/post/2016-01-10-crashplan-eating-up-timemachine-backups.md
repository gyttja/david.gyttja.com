I recently upgraded to El Capitan and while checking the system logs I noticed lots of errors about not being able to delete old backups (thin backups), such as:

These seemed a bit disconcerting: TimeMachine was having issues thinning old backups on my TimeCapsule, and worse yet, TimeMachine couldn't thin the MobileBackups on my MacBook Pro, meaning my already size-challenged SSD was being filled up by backups that would never be deleted. After lots and lots of googling, I finally found [this post which has fixed the problem](https://discussions.apple.com/message/29277434#29277434)!

It seems when you install CrashPlan, it sets file system attributes that do not allow itself to get deleted. So with a bit of command-line wizardry, we can fix this problem. We need to remove the attributes from all instances of CrashPlan.app in all backed-up locations.

Fix the MobileBackups:

1. `sudo su root` to change to the root user (be careful!)
2. `find /.MobileBackups -type d -iname crashplan.app` to look for all backed-up instances of CrashPlan.app
3. For each found instance, do this: `/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass chflags noschg,nouchg path/to/CrashPlan.app` replace path/to/CrashPlan.app to the path found in #2
4. `exit` to exit from the root account

Do the same for MobileBackups.trash:

1. `sudo su root` to change to the root user (be careful!)
2. `find /.MobileBackups.trash -type d -iname crashplan.app` to look for all backed-up instances of CrashPlan.app
3. For each found instance, do this: `/System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass chflags noschg,nouchg path/to/CrashPlan.app` replace path/to/CrashPlan.app to the path found in #2
4. `exit` to exit from the root account

Now, mount the TimeMachine backup disk and sparsebundle, and fix the attributes on all the backups there:

1. `sudo su root` to change to the root user (be careful!)
2. `cd /Volumes/Time\ Machine\ Backups/Backups.backupdb/{machine name}/`
3. Since I had so many backups, I wrote a quick one-liner script: `for dir in `ls`; do /System/Library/Extensions/TMSafetyNet.kext/Contents/Helpers/bypass chflags noschg,nouchg "${dir}/Macintosh HD/Applications/CrashPlan.app"; done`
4. `exit` to exit from the root account

And finally, add /Applications/CrashPlan.app to the excluded list for TimeMachine backups so that it is not backed up again.

Done!

After I did the above, I triggered a new TimeMachine backup, checked the logs, no more errors! And I checked my hard drive: I had now gained 18GB of space! TimeMachine was finally able to delete/trim the old unused Mobile Backups! :)
