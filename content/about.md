ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a software developer in Stockholm, Sweden, working for an international consulting company. My blog is mostly guides and how-tos of little projects I've done here and there. I hope you can benefit from these posts, but mostly they are here to help remind me how I got from A to B six months later when I forget, as I inevitably will. ðŸ˜†

Thanks for reading!<br />
